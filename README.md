**Founder-Engineer | AI-First Product Builder | Startup Technologist**

I build **real systems** that solve **real problems** — fast.
My work lives at the intersection of **AI, backend systems, and product engineering**.

I’m not attached to stacks.
I’m attached to **outcomes**.

Right now I’m experimenting across **AI, EdTech, civic tech, and SaaS**, with one long-term objective:

> Work on technology startups deeply integrated with intelligent systems.

##  What I Actually Do

I design and ship **production-grade platforms**, not just demos:

* Architect scalable backend systems
* Design secure APIs & authentication flows
* Train and deploy machine learning models
* Convert messy real-world problems into working software

My core advantage is **speed + systems thinking** — I move from idea → architecture → code → deployment rapidly, without losing structural integrity.

##  Flagship Systems

###  **Learning Management System (LMS)**

**React.js • Flask • PostgreSQL • SQLAlchemy**

A full-stack academic platform with:

* Admin, Teacher, Student & Parent roles
* Course & timetable management
* Bulk admin operations
* Clean modular architecture for scaling

Built as a **real product**, not a toy project.

---

###  **Electronic Voting System**

**Python • Flask • PostgreSQL**

A secure digital voting platform designed for:

* Authentication & result integrity
* Large voter groups
* Real-world deployment constraints

This project forced me to think about **security, reliability, and trust**, not just code.

###  **School Communication App**

**React Native • FastAPI • Python**

A cross-platform app for school communication and role-based dashboards.
Awarded **1st Prize at a Science Fair** for system design and presentation.

### **Timetable Generator**

Javascript • Constraint Optimization • CSV Pipelines

Live: https://tg.hplusplus.tech

A constraint-based scheduling engine built to solve a real operational bottleneck in academic institutions.

Automatically generates optimized class timetables

Supports variable constraints (teachers, rooms, subjects, slots)

Exports schedules as structured CSVs for downstream systems

Eliminates fragile manual rebuilding after small changes

This system converts a traditionally human-heavy planning problem into a deterministic, software-driven pipeline, saving time, reducing errors, and enabling rapid iteration when constraints shift.

##  AI & Machine Learning

AI is not a side skill — it is my **strategic edge**.

I work with:

* Machine learning models (classification, clustering, CNNs)
* Data pipelines with Pandas
* Model explainability (SHAP, XGBoost, etc.)
* System-level AI integration into real products

My direction is clear:

> **AI-driven systems that make software adaptive, intelligent, and autonomous.**

---

##  How I Work

I’m stack-agnostic and outcome-driven.
I’ve shipped with:

- **Backend:** Python, Flask, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy

- **Frontend:** React.js, React Native, Tailwind, Bootstrap

- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB

- **Infra:** Linux, Git, CLI-based workflows

I choose tools based on **leverage**, not fashion.
